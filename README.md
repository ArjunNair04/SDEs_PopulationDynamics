# Stochastic Differential Equations & Population Dynamics

This repository contains code and data for an undergraduate project fitting and diagnosing stochastic differential‐equation (SDE) models to population data. We cover three classic models:

1. **Stochastic Logistic** — single‐species growth on three media (microbial OD data)
2. **Stochastic Lotka–Volterra** — predator–prey fit to the Hudson’s Bay lynx–hare dataset
3. **Stochastic Rosenzweig–MacArthur** — predator–prey with saturating functional response

Within each file, there are accompanying diagnostics, simulation overlays, and parameter estimates.
